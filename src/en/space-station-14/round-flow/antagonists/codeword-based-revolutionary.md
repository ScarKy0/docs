# Codeword based conversion for revolutionaries

|ScarKy0|

## Overview

Codeword based conversion is meant to change the way that the head revolutionaries convert others. Head Revs will start with a set of shared codewords that will change every 5-10 minutes. Those codewords will follow a general theme of things such as "Coup, Revolution, Overthrow..." etc. While Head Revs speak them out loud next to crew members they will slowly covert, which would be a hidden variable. This does not aim at fixing the team deathmatch side of the revs gamemode and is simply an idea as to how make conversion make sense roleplay wise without breaking the metashield.


## Background

Current revolutionaries gamemode is generally disliked due to the fact of how it interacts with the metashield and is very hard to not metagame due to flashes being an obvious sign of a revolutionary. The goal here is to give a roleplay reason to suspect a revolution other than an obvious flash, as if security sees someone speak of overthrowing the station or establishing a new order that's already an in-character reason for concern better than simply seeing someone get stunned, which makes no sense IC other than carrying around contraband.


## Codewords

At the start of the round, after all head revs are chosen, a list of 4-5 codewords will get selected, all of which are shared between head revs. Those codewords are meant to follow the general idea of starting a revolution as to give security a reason to be worried about a possible revolution without selling it outright, meaning some of them will have to be vague enough as to only hint as the possibility of it.

The codewords while spoken locally would increase the "coversion" of any nearby crew hearing them. The conversion amount is based on how many codewords are spoken in a sentence, distance between crew and the head rev, whether they're whispering or shouting and will drastically lowered if the majority of the words in a sentence is codewords, as to prevent sudden spam to ensure a huge increase in conversion.

Codewords should change every 5-10 minutes into new randomly chosen ones to not make it possible to figure out the current heads based on the fact they repeat the same words. This ensures conversion makes more sense thematically as well as introducing an element of investigation for security as to figure out who are the main people behind such speech. (I would get very annoyed if someone tried to convince me to things by repeating the same thing over and over again).


## Conversion cooldown

Upon hearing conversion codewords each crewmember will enter a "cooldown" based on the amount they just got converted. This is to ensure you cannot run into bar, CTRL+C CTRL+V to suddenly have everyone at bar become a revolutionary. Additionally, if your conversion hasn't increased in a while it will start to slowly decay as you "lose interest" in the revolution.


## Regular revolutionaries

Revolutionaries get the ability to convert others too, however they do not have access to the current codewords, having to listen to things that the head revs say as to spread their ideas across the station. They also cannot fully convert people as to prevent snowballing, capping at around 50% before the head revolutionary must take lead.


## Revolution warning

If security was still oblivious as to a revolution starting, a central command announcement could notify the station of their radars sensing a growing hostility within the station's personel. This announcement could play when around 20% of the crew has converted. An announcement further plays into the idea of CentComm's "omnipotence", which even if just treated as a way to make sure people can prepare for a revolutionary attack still serves it's purpose. 


## Expected gameplay

With this idea implemented, Head Revs are rewarded for speaking out openly about the revolution, which mainly brings the following gamplay elements:
1. Speaking in a group, while obviously gaining more conversion, also is more likely to grab attention of nearby security officers.
2. It's no longer possible to stealthily convert people until it's too late and everyone gets gunned down while off guard.
3. Most importantly, the idea of a revolution being started definitely is better for roleplay purposes than suddenly getting mind controlled with a flash of light.
